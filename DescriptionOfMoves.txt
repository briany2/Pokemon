We should be using only basic moves that deal damage or cause a basic condition (Burn, Sleep, Poison, Paralyzed, Freeze) (Confusion might not be the best)

PHYSICAL category takes the attack of the attacking pokemon and subtracts it by the defense of the defending pokemon.
SPECIAL category takes the Special Attack of the attacking pokemon and subtracts it by the special defense of the defending pokemon.
STATUS category causes a chance of a condition to happen. (Listed above)

For the descriptions, I looked up the move on Bulbapedia and took the first row of the description.

(If Time)
We can also use the basic stat lowering moves such as Tail Whip (Lowers Defense).
That way, it would be much simpler to implement.
